                <h1>Two Weeks of Code: The Blog is Live!"</h1>
                <p>
                    In the span of two weeks, I undertook a coding challenge and successfully
                    completed it. To share my journey and showcase my progress,
                    I created a website blog. This platform serves as a testament
                    to my dedication and growth, offering insights into the intricacies
                    of my coding adventure.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    My coding journey began with the exploration of the Apache web server. Understanding its workings
                    was a challenge, but it was a necessary step in my journey. I spent countless hours configuring my
                    Apache server, tweaking settings, and testing results. This experience gave me a solid foundation in
                    server management and a deeper understanding of how websites are served. </p>

                <h1>Sketching the Future with Wireframes

                </h1>
                <p>
                    After setting up my server, I moved on to wireframing. This step was crucial in understanding how a
                    website should be designed. I sketched out my website design, visualizing the layout and user
                    interface. This process helped me to plan the structure of my site and paved the way for the next
                    steps in my coding journey.

                <h1>Building Blocks of the Web: HTML‚Äù</h1>
                <p>
                    With a design in hand, I dove into HTML. Learning HTML was like learning the alphabet of the web. It
                    allowed me to turn my wireframe sketches into a tangible, interactive format. I learned about tags,
                    elements, and attributes, and how they come together to form the structure of a website. </p>

                <h1>Styling the Web with CSS and Grid</h1>
                <p>
                    After HTML, I jumped into CSS. It was easier to understand, and using grid layouts helped me a lot.
                    CSS allowed me to bring my website to life, adding colors, fonts, and layouts. The grid system was
                    particularly helpful in creating complex layouts with ease. It was like painting on a canvas, but
                    the canvas was my website. </p>

                <p>
                    The final step in my journey was learning JavaScript. This allowed me to make my website
                    interactive. I could make paragraphs move, create responsive navigation menus, and much more.
                    JavaScript was the final piece of the puzzle, turning my static website into a dynamic platform.

                <p>
                    With the basics in place, I embraced Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to breathe life into my designs.
                    This part of the blog highlights the role of CSS, especially the powerful CSS Grid, in enhancing the
                    aesthetics of my website. It explores the journey of transforming static structures into visually
                    pleasing and dynamically responsive web pages.
